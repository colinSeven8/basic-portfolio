            <p>Greetings, humans.  I know that this old high school picture of me probably looks like I'm saying, "hey, dude", but I'm really not.  Back then, having bleached hair and sideburns was a thing - not so much now.</p>
            <p>Some of my interests include artwork, soccer, biking, skateboarding, snowboarding, running around in the mountains, and melting faces with my guitar.  I've been interested in coding for a long time, and have written small applications independently here and there over the years.  I was introduced to Web development a couple of years ago and decided this is the way to go.  I'm really excited to finally get the formal training I've wanted.</p>
